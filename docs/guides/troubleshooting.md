# Troubleshooting

## Start here

```sh
hyprshell deps missing     # what is absent, and what each absence costs
hyprshell shell ping       # is the shell even up
hyprshell config path      # which config is being read
RUST_LOG=debug hyprshell   # the warnings, including dropped ids
```

`deps missing` answers most of this page in one line each, and it is answered by the binary — so it works when
nothing started.

## A chip is missing entirely

Three causes, in order of likelihood:

1. **It is not in a zone.** `[bars.<edge>] start|center|end` — an id not listed is not shown.
2. **Its id was dropped.** An unknown module id is dropped with a log warning rather than failing the bar. Check
   the spelling against [features/modules](../features/modules/); `RUST_LOG=info` prints it.
3. **Its dependency is absent, and its rule is "hide".** Bluetooth with no BlueZ, battery with no battery,
   media with no player, and the four Hyprland-bound modules on another compositor are all hidden by design.

## A chip is there but empty, or reads unknown

Its source is missing, and the module's rule is "degrade" rather than "hide". `hyprshell deps missing` names
which. The common ones:

| Empty | Install |
| --- | --- |
| volume, mic, mixer | PipeWire (`pw-dump`, `wpctl`) |
| the visualiser | PipeWire (`pw-cat`) |
| network panel (chip still works) | NetworkManager |
| GPU fields | nothing on AMD/Intel — check `/sys/class/drm`; NVML on NVIDIA |
| external monitor brightness | `ddcutil` |

A reading that cannot be taken reports **unknown**, never zero — so an unknown GPU is not a GPU at 0 %.

## The shell will not start

```sh
hyprshell deps check
```

Exactly one thing can cause it: no `wlr-layer-shell`. Everything else degrades.

## A command is refused

The reply begins with `err` and says why. Two common ones:

- **`unknown target` / `unknown command`** — `hyprshell --list` is the authoritative menu.
- **`the session cannot be locked`** — either `ext-session-lock` is missing or libpam could not be loaded. That
  is checked *before* the screen is covered, on purpose. `hyprshell lock status` gives the same answer without
  locking.

## A keybind does nothing

Check the command by hand first — `hyprshell launcher toggle` in a terminal. If that works, the bind is the
problem, not the shell. If you bound it through the portal, remember the name is `:launcher`, not
`hyprshell:launcher`, on a non-sandboxed install.

## The config changed and nothing happened

Saving `config.toml` reloads it. If it did not:

- **Check the file being read** — `hyprshell config path`. A per-monitor file at
  `monitors/<output>/config.toml` overrides the global one for that screen.
- **Check the key exists** — `hyprshell config schema <section>` prints every real key. An unknown key is
  ignored silently.
- **Force it** — `hyprshell shell reload`.

There is no validation report yet, so a wrong key is a log line rather than an error on screen.

## An external monitor's brightness is out of step

Levels are read once at detection and tracked optimistically, because a `getvcp` costs tens to hundreds of
milliseconds per monitor. A change made with the monitor's own buttons is not noticed.

```sh
hyprshell brightness refresh
```

## The tray is empty

hyprshell is the tray host. An empty tray usually means no application has published an item yet — or that
another shell already owns `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher`, in which case hyprshell reads that watcher's list
instead and the two are consistent.

## Bluetooth will not pair

The shell registers no `org.bluez.Agent1`, so a device asking for a PIN or a passkey confirmation cannot
complete pairing here. Pair it once with `bluetoothctl`; everything afterwards works from the panel.

## Something is slow, or the shell is warm at idle

```sh
TELAR_PERF=1 hyprshell     # per-phase frame timing
```

An idle shell should sit at 0 % CPU. The one service that publishes at a frame rate is the visualiser, and it
only runs while something is subscribed to it.
