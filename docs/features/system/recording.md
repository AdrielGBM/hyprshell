# Screen recording

Unlike a screenshot, a recording is not something a shell can do itself: it is an encoder, a muxer and a frame
pump, and every Wayland session already has one. So hyprshell owns the **session** — which backend, what it is
recording, since when — rather than the pixels.

## Recording

```sh
hyprshell record start [screen|output|region]
hyprshell record stop
hyprshell record toggle          # stop, or start one of the whole screen
hyprshell record pause           # on a backend that can
hyprshell record status
hyprshell record list            # newest first
```

A region opens the picker first, the same one screenshots use.

## Stopping properly

`stop` sends **`SIGINT`** and lets the encoder write its own trailer. A recorder that is killed rather than
interrupted leaves an unplayable file, which is the one thing a wrapper around a recorder has to get right.

One process at a time, tracked by pid, owned by a waiter thread rather than by whoever pressed stop — so a
recorder that exits on its own (a full disk, a missing codec) updates the shell exactly like one you stopped.

## Configuring

`[recorder]` — `backend`, `fps`, `audio`, `audio_device`, `file_name`, `max_entries`, `notify`.
`[paths] recordings` is the folder.

## What it needs

One of two programs:

| Backend | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| **`wf-recorder`** | CPU encoding |
| **`gpu-screen-recorder`** | GPU encoding, and the only backend that can **pause** |

With neither installed, recording is unavailable — the toggle is present and refuses. With only `wf-recorder`,
everything works except `record pause`.
