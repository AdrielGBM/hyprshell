# Notification daemon

hyprshell owns `org.freedesktop.Notifications` itself. There is no second daemon to install, and running one
alongside means whichever claims the bus name first wins.

## What it does

Receives notifications, pops them, groups them by application, stores them, and keeps a history that survives a
restart.

```sh
hyprshell notifs dnd toggle
hyprshell notifs mute <app> [on|off|toggle]
hyprshell notifs muted
hyprshell notifs clear [app]
hyprshell notifs center toggle
```

## Do-not-disturb, and what it means

Under DND a notification is **kept, not shown** — it goes to history and does not pop. That is the property
that distinguishes a notification from a [toast](../surfaces/toasts.md): a toast under DND would be
meaningless, because a toast is feedback about something you just did.

Per-application mute is a separate, binary switch.

## Configuring

`[notifications]` — `body_lines`, `group_by_app`, `group_preview_num`, `open_expanded`, `critical_sticky`,
`clear_threshold`, `action_on_click`, `fullscreen`, `sound`.

Where a popup appears, how wide it is, how many show at once and how long each stays are not the daemon's: a
notification popup, a toast and an OSD are one column, and the column is `[stack]` — `edge`, `align`, `width`,
`max_visible`, `timeout_ms`.

`critical_sticky` keeps urgency-critical notifications up until they are dismissed. `fullscreen` is the policy
for what happens while a window is fullscreen.

## Interacting

Actions, swipe-to-dismiss and click-through-to-the-application all work from the popup and from the history.

## What it needs

Nothing. The daemon is part of the shell, and the popup host is always mapped — a notification can arrive at any
moment and the daemon owns the timing.

## Known limits

- **Per-application rules stop at mute.** There is no matching on summary or body, no forcing an urgency, and
  no routing straight to history.
- **A notification's action cannot be invoked over IPC.** `notifs` answers `clear`, `mute`, `muted`, `dnd` and
  `center`; acting on an action is UI-only.
