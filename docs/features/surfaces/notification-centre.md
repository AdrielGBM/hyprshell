# Notification centre

## What it is

The full-height counterpart to the bell drawer. It takes a whole screen edge, it scrolls, and it is where you
work through a morning's notifications.

```sh
hyprshell notifs center toggle
hyprshell notifs center open
```

## Drawer or centre?

| | Bell drawer | Notification centre |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anchored to | the chip that opened it | a screen edge |
| Height | its content | the whole edge |
| Closes | when you look away | when you close it |
| For | a glance | working through a backlog |

## What is on it

The notification history, grouped by application, and the **utilities panel's own toggles** — not a second set
of them. That is the whole reason the two were built together: two independent copies of "turn Wi-Fi off" would
drift the day one of them gained a toggle.

Both halves are switchable: `[sidebar] show_history` and `show_toggles`.

## Configuring

`[sidebar]` — `edge`, `size`, `show_history`, `show_toggles`.

The toggles themselves come from `[utilities] toggles`; the history's grouping and thresholds from
`[notifications]`.

## What it needs

`wlr-layer-shell`, plus whatever each toggle needs.
