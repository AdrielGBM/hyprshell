# Wallpaper layer

One surface per monitor, at the bottom of the background layer. It paints the image this screen should show,
cover-cropped over the theme's base colour, and nothing else — a clock or a visualiser on the desktop is
[Desktop widgets](widgets.md), on a surface of its own.

## Choosing an image

```sh
hyprshell wallpaper set ~/pictures/x.jpg    # every screen
hyprshell wallpaper set ~/pictures/x.jpg DP-2
hyprshell wallpaper random [output]
hyprshell wallpaper clear [output]          # back to what your config says
hyprshell wallpaper list
```

The launcher's `@` mode is the same library as a grid.

## Which image a screen shows

Resolution order, most specific first:

1. the runtime per-output choice,
2. the runtime global one,
3. `[background.monitors]`,
4. `[background] image`.

An image you pinned in your config keeps showing until something sets one at runtime, and `wallpaper clear`
puts you back. The runtime choice lives in `state.json`, not in `config.toml`: a wallpaper picked at random is
state the shell owns, not a preference you hand-edited.

## The transition

A wallpaper change is an **event on the live surface**, not a rebuild — a fresh tree has nothing left of the
old image to fade *from*. `[background] transition` and `transition_ms` control the cross-fade.

## The library

`[paths] wallpapers` is scanned recursively, with a thumbnail cache so a grid of two hundred images does not
decode two hundred full-resolution photographs.

`[wallpaper]` — `enabled`, `recursive`, `extensions`, `max_entries`, `thumbnail_size`.

## What it needs

`wlr-layer-shell`.
