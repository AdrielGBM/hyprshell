# Palettes

```sh
hyprshell scheme list             # what `scheme set` accepts
hyprshell scheme set nord
hyprshell scheme mode toggle
hyprshell scheme status           # theme, mode, variant, and the wallpaper it came from
hyprshell scheme colors           # every token now on screen, as name and hex
```

## The built-ins

`nord` `rose-pine` `rose-pine-moon` `rose-pine-dawn` `catppuccin-mocha` `catppuccin-macchiato`
`catppuccin-frappe` `catppuccin-latte` `gruvbox` `gruvbox-light` `tokyo-night` `everforest`

A name is reduced to what identifies it before it is matched, so `rose-pine`, `rose_pine` and `rosepine` are
one theme — a separator preference never becomes an "unknown theme" warning.

## Light and dark

`[theme] mode` is `dark`, `light` or `auto`. Switching mode maps a palette to its counterpart where there is
one — `catppuccin-frappe` becomes `catppuccin-latte`, `gruvbox` becomes `gruvbox-light`.

**`auto` means "keep whatever the palette already is".** It is *not* a sunrise/sunset switch; there is no clock
driving a mode change yet.

## Your own colours

`[theme.colors]` overrides individual tokens on top of whichever palette is selected, as `#rrggbb`. Setting
`[theme] name = "custom"` starts from nord and lets the config say the rest.

`[theme] accent` picks the accent token; a module can override it for itself with `[modules.<id>] accent`.

## Type and scale

`[theme] font_family` and `[theme.fonts.*]` — `display`, `title`, `body`, `caption` — set the type.
`[theme.scale]` — `font`, `icon`, `rounding`, `spacing` — scales the whole shell without touching every key.

> `[theme.scale]` is a **manual** multiplier. The shell does not ask the compositor for a fractional scale
> (`wp-fractional-scale-v1` is unbound), so on a 1.5× output the compositor scales the shell's buffer rather
> than the shell rendering at the true device-pixel grid. Text is slightly soft as a result.

## Icons

`[icons]` — `provider`, `default_set`, `app_icon_theme`. Icons come from an Iconify-compatible endpoint
(`{provider}/{set}/{name}.svg`); a name may override the set inline as `mdi:home`. The provider is
configurable because Iconify is self-hostable.

## What it needs

Nothing.
