# Launcher chip

A square icon chip whose only job is to open the launcher. Everything the launcher *is* — the modes, the
ranking, the actions — is on its own page: **[Launcher](../surfaces/launcher.md)**.

## Interacting

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click | toggles the launcher |

Equivalent to `hyprshell launcher toggle`, which is what most people bind to a key instead of putting the chip
on a bar.

## Configuring

The chip has no settings of its own. `[launcher]` configures the surface it opens.

## What it needs

Nothing.
