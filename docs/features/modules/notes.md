# Notes

## What it shows

A chip that opens a panel you can type in. The panel takes keyboard focus — it is one of the three surfaces
that do, alongside the launcher and the session menu.

## Interacting

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click | opens the notes panel |

```sh
hyprshell panel toggle notes
```

## Configuring

No section of its own. `[modules.notes]` carries the usual presentation overrides — whether the panel opens as
a drawer or a float, and that float's size.

## What it needs

Nothing. Notes are stored in `notes.toml` under the shell's data directory, written as you type.
