# Active window

The title of whatever has focus, truncated to fit a bar rather than pushing everything else off it.

## What it shows

The focused window's title, optionally with its application icon. `compact` drops to the application name
instead of the title, which is the reading that stays a fixed width as you move between windows.

`inverted` swaps the two, so the application name leads and the title follows.

## Interacting

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click | focuses the window it names |
| Hover | a popout card with the untruncated title, the class and the workspace |

The chip is the only place the full title is available at a glance — a bar has room for one line, and
`max_chars` is what keeps it to one.

## Configuring

`[active_window]` — `compact`, `inverted`, `max_chars`, `show_icon`. Run
`hyprshell config schema active_window` for what each does.

## What it needs

Hyprland's IPC socket. The reading is the compositor's focused client, and Hyprland's `.socket2.sock` event
stream is the only route implemented — there is no `ext-foreign-toplevel-list-v1` binding yet. On another
compositor the chip is hidden rather than blank.

Nothing else: no external program, no D-Bus peer.
