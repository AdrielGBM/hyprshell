# Keyboard layout

## What it shows

The main keyboard's active layout.

## Interacting

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click | cycles to the next layout |
| Hover | a popout card naming the layout in full |

```sh
hyprshell keyboard layout    # which one
hyprshell keyboard next      # switch
```

## Configuring

The layouts themselves are the compositor's — hyprshell reads and cycles them, it does not define them.

`[toasts.events] kb_layout` decides whether a switch also raises a [toast](../surfaces/toasts.md), which is
the useful part when you switch with a keybind and the bar is on another screen.

## What it needs

Hyprland's IPC socket, for both halves: reading the active layout and switching it. On another compositor the
chip is hidden.
