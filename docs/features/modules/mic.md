# Microphone

## What it shows

The default source's level, and whether it is muted. This is the *volume* of the microphone — not whether
something is currently using it. There is no privacy indicator yet.

## Interacting

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click | toggles mute, with the OSD |
| Scroll | adjusts the level by `[audio] increment`, with the OSD |
| Hover | a popout card with the level and the device name |

```sh
hyprshell mic mute
hyprshell mic set 60
hyprshell mic step -5
```

## Configuring

`[audio]` — `increment`, `max_volume`. Shared with [volume](volume.md), because the step you want on a
function key is the same step either way.

`[toasts.events] audio_input` raises a toast on a mute change; `[osd]` decides where the overlay appears.

## What it needs

**PipeWire.** `pw-dump` for the graph — devices, streams, levels and mutes — and `wpctl` for mutations.

Without `pw-dump` every audio module stays empty. Without `wpctl` audio can be read but not adjusted.

Reading and writing are deliberately different tools: `pw-dump --monitor` is *one* long-lived process that
parses JSON only when the graph changes, and `wpctl` is one fork per mutation. A level changed from another
mixer reaches the bar as PipeWire reports it, not up to two seconds later.
