# Session

## What it shows

A power icon. The panel behind it is the session menu: lock, log out, suspend, hibernate, reboot, shut down.

Actions this machine cannot perform are **greyed out rather than offered**, because logind can be asked first
— `CanHibernate` is a question, so the menu does not show a button that would fail.

## Interacting

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click | opens the session menu |

```sh
hyprshell session list                 # what this machine supports
hyprshell session do suspend
hyprshell lock on
```

## Configuring

`[lock]` for what locking does — see [Lock screen](../system/lock.md).

## What it needs

**logind**, on the system bus. Every action goes through it rather than through `systemctl`, for two reasons:
it works without privileges, since logind decides what the active session's user may do, and it can be *asked*
first.

Without logind the session actions are unavailable.
