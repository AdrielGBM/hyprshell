//! Every preview, laid out on all four edges in all three shape modes, measured rather than merely built.
//!
//! `cargo telar test` renders each preview once and fails on a panic or a layout error, which is
//! `assert!(build().is_ok())` — and that passes for every layout bug this tree has actually had: a result list
//! laid out 612×**0** because a `max_height` is not a height, a wallpaper row measuring shorter than the tiles
//! inside it, an avatar drawn outside its scrolling viewport. Each was found by looking at a picture, and each
//! is a fact about *geometry*, which is why this measures the draw commands instead of comparing stored images:
//! a baseline would also have to be told apart from a font that shaped differently on the machine running it,
//! and a suite that cries wolf is one people delete.
//!
//! The twelve combinations are the shell's own hard rule — every surface and every module works on all four
//! edges and in `bar`, `sections` and `chips` — so a module only ever looked at on a top bar is exactly where a
//! shape bug survives.
//!
//! **"Did the preview draw anything at all?" took a correction to become askable.** It reported 79 of 456
//! combinations blank, and the reading taken from that was that `battery`, `brightness`, `mic`, `network`,
//! `volume` and `lockstatus` have no reading on a machine with no battery and no PipeWire — a hardware-dependent
//! answer, and so a flaky assertion. That was wrong twice over: those chips draw their glyph at a fallback level
//! and are on screen, and what was blank was the *accounting*. Every icon is an SVG, an SVG is a `Path`, and
//! only boxes were counted — so a chip whose whole content is an icon was invisible to this file rather than
//! measured by it. [`paints`] counts artwork too, which makes the question machine-independent rather than
//! merely askable.
//!
//! **What this cannot ask: *"did anything draw outside its surface?"* — the avatar bug.** Not for the reason
//! it looks like. Draw rects being pre-transform is twelve lines of matrix stack, which telar already owns in
//! `DrawState` and merely does not re-export; and content legitimately below the fold has a clean discriminator,
//! since a scroll area emits a viewport and being outside one is what scrolling means, so a draw that nothing is
//! clipping has no such reading. What blocks it is that **a preview has no bounds to be outside of**:
//! `PreviewSurface` is a sizing hint rather than a viewport — `surfaces::preview` gives the bar 940 × its
//! thickness on purpose — and entries stack their variants well past it. Measured, the check calls every such
//! gallery a fault. Asking it needs real surfaces, which a sweep over previews does not have.
