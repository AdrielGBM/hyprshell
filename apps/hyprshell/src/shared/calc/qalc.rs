//! The fallback evaluator: whatever `qalc` can answer that the in-house one cannot.
//!
//! Qalculate knows currencies, physical constants, date arithmetic and a units table far larger than the one next
//! door. It is also a process, and starting one per keystroke on the UI thread would stall the frame for as long
//! as it takes to load — so this goes through `shared::asset`: ask, get a signal, and let the worker fill it in.
//!
//! Asked *only* when the query is explicitly a calculation (the `=` prefix) and the in-house evaluator has already
//! declined. An app search must never spawn a process, and a question with a local answer must never wait for one.
