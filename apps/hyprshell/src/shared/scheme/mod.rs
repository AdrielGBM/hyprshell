//! Colour schemes derived from the wallpaper.
//!
//! `[theme] name = "dynamic"` resolves through here instead of through [`NordTheme::named`]: an image is reduced
//! to one seed colour, and that seed is expanded into the same token set every built-in palette fills, so every
//! surface picks a dynamic scheme up through the reload path it already has. Nothing downstream learns a new
//! concept — a dynamic theme is a `NordTheme` like any other.
//!
//! Two decisions are worth stating up front.
//!
//! **The ramp is built in OkLCH, not RGB.** A palette is a set of lightness steps at a shared hue, and only a
//! perceptual space makes "one step lighter" mean the same thing at every hue; the same nudge in RGB moves a
//! yellow far more than a blue.
//!
//! **Semantic colours keep their own hue.** An error that came out green because the wallpaper was a forest is
//! not a theme, it is a bug. `red`/`green`/`yellow`/`blue` are pinned to fixed hues and only *harmonised* toward
//! the seed — rotated by at most [`HARMONY`] degrees — which is enough to make them belong to the palette and
//! not enough to make them lie.
