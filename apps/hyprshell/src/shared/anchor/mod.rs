//! Placing a surface against the bar chip that opened it.
//!
//! A bar is only its own thickness tall, so anything larger than a chip has to become a surface of its own.
//! The tray's context menus and the hover popouts anchor the same way: the chip's laid-out rect decides where
//! the surface sits along the bar, and the bar's edge decides which side it hangs off. No platform capability
//! beyond an anchor and a margin is involved, which is why both work on all four edges unchanged.
