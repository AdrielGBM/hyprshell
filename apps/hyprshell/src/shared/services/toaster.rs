//! In-shell toasts: the small, self-dismissing messages the shell says about itself.
//!
//! Deliberately not freedesktop notifications. A notification is a record — it belongs to an application, it goes
//! into history, it can be acted on, and under Do-Not-Disturb it is *kept* rather than shown. "Caps Lock is on"
//! is none of those things: it is feedback about a key the user just pressed, it is worthless a second later, and
//! filing it in the notification history would be filing the user's own keystrokes. So toasts have their own
//! queue, their own surface and their own per-event switches, and nothing here reaches the daemon.
//!
//! Expiry runs on a thread of its own. Toasts are posted from wherever the event happened — a service thread, an
//! IPC handler, a click — so the one thing they cannot rely on is a surface being up to time them out.
