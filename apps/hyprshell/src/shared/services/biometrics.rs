//! Unlocking without typing: a fingerprint through fprintd, and a face through Howdy.
//!
//! Both are *alternatives* to the password, never replacements. They run alongside the field, they stop the
//! moment the screen unlocks, and each has its own attempt budget — after which the shell stops asking and
//! leaves the password as the only way in. That ordering is the whole safety argument: a biometric that keeps
//! retrying forever is a sensor an attacker can keep feeding.
//!
//! Neither is required. fprintd is a D-Bus service that simply is not on the bus without a reader; Howdy is a
//! command that is not installed. In both cases the lock screen behaves as though the feature were switched
//! off, which is what `[lock] fingerprint` / `howdy_command` also do explicitly.
