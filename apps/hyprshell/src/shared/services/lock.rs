//! Whether the session is locked, and everything that decides it.
//!
//! One state, three writers and one performer. The **writers** are the session menu, `hyprshell lock`, logind's
//! `Lock`/`Unlock` signals and the idle timers — all of which do nothing but change [`LockState`]. The
//! **performer** is [`on_state`], which runs on the driver thread and is the only place that takes or releases
//! the compositor's session lock. Splitting them that way is what makes a lock requested from a keybind, from
//! `loginctl`, and from a click the same lock rather than three racing attempts at one.
//!
//! Two things are checked *before* the screen is covered, never after: that the compositor implements
//! `ext-session-lock-v1`, and that PAM can be loaded. A lock this process cannot undo is the one failure with
//! no way out for the user, so it is refused with a message instead.
