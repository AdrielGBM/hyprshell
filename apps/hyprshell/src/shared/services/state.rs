//! What the shell remembers across restarts.
//!
//! Distinct from `config.toml`, which the user owns and hand-edits: this is machine-written state — which
//! wallpaper is up, whether do-not-disturb is on, how often each app was launched. It lives in
//! `$XDG_STATE_HOME/hyprshell/state.json` so a reload, a restart or a re-login lands back where the user left
//! off, and so a toggle flipped from one surface is the same toggle every other surface reads.
