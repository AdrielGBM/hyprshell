//! The other half of the composition root, beside [`crate::core::registry`]: the drawer, the float and the
//! settings preview all present *a module's panel*, and this is the one place that says which module that is.
//! Keeping it here rather than beside the drawer is what lets a surface be built without the modules it shows.
//!
//! `session` takes the keyboard for the second reason the mode exists: its tiles are a list, and a menu whose
//! most destructive entries are two presses away is exactly the one a user wants to reach without moving their
//! hand to the mouse.
