//! The shell's command surface: one Unix socket, a flat `<target> <command> [args…]` protocol.
//!
//! Everything the shell can be told to do from outside — a Hyprland keybind, a script, another shell — arrives
//! here. Commands run on the driver thread, the same thread every surface lives on, so a handler can open a
//! panel or publish to a service exactly as a click handler would.
//!
//! The protocol is one request line in and one reply out, so `hyprshell panel toggle clock` is also
//! `printf 'panel toggle clock\n' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$sock`. Replies are prefixed `ok` or `err` so a script
//! can branch without parsing prose. A reply is usually one line but need not be — a census, a palette or a list
//! of monitors is a table — so its end is marked by the shell closing its side, not by a newline.
