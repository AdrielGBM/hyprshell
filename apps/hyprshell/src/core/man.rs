//! Same reason as `--list` and `config schema`, one step further out: the manual a distribution installs is the
//! copy furthest from the source and the one nobody re-reads, so writing it by hand is writing something that
//! will be wrong by the next release. The command page walks [`TARGETS`] and the config page walks
//! [`config::schema::outline`] — the two tables that already cannot drift from what the shell does — so a
//! command or a key reaches the manual by existing.
//!
//! Roff by hand rather than through scdoc or mandoc: the output is a few hundred lines of a format that has not
//! moved in decades, and a generator that needs a tool installed to produce documentation is a build dependency
//! a packager pays for nothing.
