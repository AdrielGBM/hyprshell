//! The shell's live context and its open-surface registry.
//!
//! Two things every entry point needs and no single bar owns. **The context** is the config the shell is
//! currently running (kept in step with the reload watcher) plus the compositor's focused monitor, so code
//! reached from outside a surface — an IPC call, a keybind — can still answer "which config? which screen?".
//! **The registry** is what is open right now, so a panel toggled from a bar chip, from `hyprshell panel
//! toggle`, and from a keybind are all the *same* surface rather than three stacked copies.
//!
//! What is in the registry is what the *user* opened. The surfaces the *config* describes — the bars, their
//! reservation strips, the wallpaper, the frame — are [`crate::core::surfaces`]'s, and the split is what makes
//! a reload safe to run at every keystroke: one side is reconciled against the file, the other is left alone.
//!
//! Both live on the driver thread, which is the one UI thread every surface shares, so they are plain
//! thread-locals rather than locks.
