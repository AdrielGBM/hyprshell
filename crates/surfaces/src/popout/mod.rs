//! Hover popouts: the readout a chip shows while the pointer rests on it.
//!
//! Distinct from the drawer a click opens, and the shell's primary status interaction: a bar chip has room for
//! one glyph, and everything that glyph stands for — the level behind it, the sensor it came from, the whole
//! window title it truncated — lives here.
//!
//! Three things make it a popout rather than a flicker. **Delays**: the pointer has to rest on a chip before
//! anything opens, and the popout survives long enough after leaving for the pointer to reach it. **One
//! surface**: moving from chip to chip replaces the card rather than stacking a second one. **A carved input
//! region**: the surface is sized to the tallest card a popout may be, and everything the card doesn't cover
//! falls through to the window underneath, so a popout that is up while you click elsewhere costs nothing.
//!
//! Placement is [`shared::anchor`](ui::anchor), the same helper the tray's context menus use.
