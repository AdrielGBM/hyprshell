//! The background surface: the wallpaper and its transition.
//!
//! One surface per monitor, at the bottom of the background layer, painting the image the wallpaper service
//! says this screen should show — cover-cropped over the theme's base colour. Nothing else: what is drawn *over*
//! the desktop is [`crate::widgets`], on a surface of its own, so a widget that repaints with the music does not
//! repaint a screen-sized photograph with it.
//!
//! **The transition is why a wallpaper change is an event and not a rebuild.** A picture chosen at runtime is
//! not a config edit — it is session state — and rebuilding the surface for it would be useless for a
//! cross-fade anyway: a fresh tree has nothing left of the old image to fade *from*. So a runtime wallpaper
//! change arrives as an event on the live surface, carrying an image the service already decoded off the UI
//! thread, and the two layers are simply ping-ponged.
