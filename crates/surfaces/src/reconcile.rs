//! What the config says should be on screen, and keeping the screen in step with it.
//!
//! The shell puts up four kinds of surface on its own: a wallpaper, a bar per edge, the invisible strip each
//! bar reserves, and the frame ring. Which of them exist, how big they are and where they sit are all answers
//! to the config, and the config is a file the user edits while the shell is running — so this module holds
//! both halves: [`plan`], which reads the config as a set of surfaces, and [`Surfaces`], which owns the live
//! ones and brings them in line with a new plan.
//!
//! **A reload reuses, it does not replace.** Every surface here has a [`Key`] that survives an edit — what it
//! is, and which screen it is on — so a config change reaches the surface that is already up: its layer-shell
//! state is renegotiated in place and its content is built again on the same surface. A surface is created
//! only when the config asks for one that is not there (a bar given its first module, a monitor plugged in)
//! and destroyed only when the config stops asking for it. Nothing blinks in between, which is what makes
//! editing the config with the settings window open bearable.
