//! What this crate's previews need before they build, and the ones it registers in Rust.
//!
//! Each of these is a *surface*, so each declares the size the compositor would give it and is rendered under
//! the same root the runner mounts — see [`telar::PreviewSurface`]. What is still the surface host's alone is
//! the clear colour behind the tree and the window's own transparency.
