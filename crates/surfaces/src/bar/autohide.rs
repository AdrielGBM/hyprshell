//! `[bars.<edge>] persistent = false`: a bar that is only on screen when it is wanted.
//!
//! The bar is not hidden by drawing it somewhere else — it is *moved*. The layer surface sits at a negative
//! margin on its own anchored edge, far enough off that only `[bars.<edge>] peek` logical pixels remain, and
//! reveals itself by animating that margin back to the bar's usual gap. Two things follow from doing it that
//! way. The bar takes no input over the strip it is not occupying, because it is genuinely not there — no input
//! region to carve, nothing to get wrong. And the peek strip is the bar's own edge rather than a second surface
//! that has to be kept in step with it, so there is one thing to place, one thing to reload, and one thing that
//! can be hovered.
//!
//! What tells it to move is the plainest possible signal: the compositor delivers `CursorEntered` and
//! `CursorLeft` to the surface, and the only part of the surface the pointer can reach while it is hidden *is*
//! the peek strip.
