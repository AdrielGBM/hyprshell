//! The vocabulary `Config` needs to express a policy about something a service produces.
//!
//! Each of these types is named by a config section — `[notifications]` gates on an urgency, `[toasts.events]`
//! on a toast event, `[weather]` resolves to a coordinate — so they belong to the config rather than to the
//! producer. The service that raises them re-exports the type from here, which is what keeps the dependency
//! pointing one way: a service knows about the config, the config knows nothing about a service.
