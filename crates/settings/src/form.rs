//! The form toolkit every settings section is built out of.
//!
//! A section is a heading, a column of fields, and one Save button. This is that vocabulary — the widgets, the
//! write-back to `config.toml`, and the recorder that tells a button whether anything under it moved — so the
//! sections themselves are a description of *which* fields they have rather than of how a field behaves.
