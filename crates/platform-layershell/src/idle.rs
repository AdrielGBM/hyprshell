//! `ext-idle-notify-v1`: how long the seat has been idle, reported by the compositor.
//!
//! The compositor is the only thing that knows. It sees every input device, it knows which surface has focus,
//! and it already tracks the idle inhibitors clients take out — so a shell that timed its own inactivity would
//! be guessing at all three, and would dim the screen under a full-screen video that had asked it not to.
//!
//! The protocol distinguishes the two questions directly, which is why `respect_inhibitors` maps onto a choice
//! of request rather than onto a condition the shell evaluates: `get_idle_notification` stays quiet while an
//! inhibitor is held, `get_input_idle_notification` reports raw input idleness regardless.
