//! The control channel between a live surface and whoever holds it.
//!
//! A layer surface used to be something the driver decided on its own: configured once when it was created and
//! never renegotiated, and closed by a flag that tore it down on the next loop turn. All of it is here instead.
//! A [`SurfaceLink`] is shared by the driver's surface entry and the `SurfaceHandle` its opener holds — one
//! side asks, the other applies on its next turn — carrying three kinds of request: the [`SurfaceUpdate`] that
//! renegotiates the surface's layer-shell state, a rebuild of its content, and the close. An [`ExitPlan`] is
//! what the surface's own content registered for the moment it is asked to close, together with how long the
//! driver must keep it mapped for that to be seen.
