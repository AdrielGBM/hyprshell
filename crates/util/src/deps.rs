//! Every external thing hyprshell needs, in one list.
//!
//! The shell reaches outside itself in five different ways — it runs programs, calls D-Bus peers, reads kernel
//! interfaces, `dlopen`s libraries and binds Wayland protocols — and until this file existed each of those was
//! described in three places that could disagree: the README's dependency table, the packaging metadata's
//! optional-depends list, and the runtime check at the call site. Three copies of one fact means two of them
//! are wrong the moment a dependency moves.
//!
//! So the declaration is made **load-bearing** rather than documentary. [`output`] and [`available`] take a
//! [`Dep`], not a program name, which means a program cannot be run without first having a row in [`ALL`] —
//! and a row carries what the panel and the CLI need to say about it. A dependency added without a row is a
//! compile error rather than a documentation drift, which is the whole point.
//!
//! Lives in `util` because it has to sit below everything that reaches outside: the callers are spread across
//! this crate and `services`, and `util` is the only crate under both.
//!
//! Nothing here probes at startup. A probe costs a process start or a bus round trip, and the answer is only
//! wanted when something asks — the panel, the CLI, or a service deciding whether to bother starting.
