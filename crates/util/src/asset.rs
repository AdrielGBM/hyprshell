//! Asking a worker thread for something the frame must not wait for.
//!
//! Cover art was the first of these and wrote the shape by hand: a request goes out, a signal comes back
//! `Loading`, and a worker fills it in later. Two more wanted the same thing for different reasons — a wallpaper
//! thumbnail is a full-resolution decode, a `qalc` answer is a subprocess — and neither is work the UI thread can
//! do between two frames. This is that shape once, so the next one is a `Loader::new` rather than a fourth copy
//! of the borrow rule below.
//!
//! The store is per-thread by construction: a `Loader` holds `Rc` signal handles, so it lives on the driver
//! thread with the surfaces that read it, and only the work itself crosses over.
