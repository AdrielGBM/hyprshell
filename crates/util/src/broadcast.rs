//! The shared-source primitive every system service is built on.
//!
//! A service owns exactly one producer — a D-Bus subscription, a socket, a watcher process — running on its own
//! thread for the whole shell. Surfaces don't read the system; they subscribe, and the producer fans each
//! reading out to all of them. N bars therefore cost one connection and one parse per change, not N, and a
//! surface never runs a timer of its own.
//!
//! A module consumes one by handing [`Service::subscribe`] to `platform_wayland::watch`, which delivers each
//! value on that surface's own loop thread and unsubscribes it when the surface goes away.
//!
//! **A producer that nobody is listening to has to stop.** Starting lazily is only half the rule: a service
//! whose last subscriber went away — the bar module switched off in a reload, the panel that closed — kept its
//! thread, its connection and its poll timer for the life of the process. A polling producer with no subscriber
//! is the clearest form of that. [`Broadcast::wanted`] is how a producer asks, and returning from the producer
//! when it answers `false` is how a service opts in; a later subscription starts a fresh one.
