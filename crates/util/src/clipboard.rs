//! Putting things on the Wayland clipboard.
//!
//! This used to hand off to `wl-copy`. It no longer does, and the reason is worth stating because the old
//! comment here gave the opposite one: Wayland does not let a client *deposit* a selection, it registers a
//! source and serves the bytes to whoever pastes, later. A one-shot process therefore cannot copy — which is
//! precisely what `wl-copy` exists to work around, by forking a daemon that stays alive holding the offer.
//!
//! A shell is already that daemon. So the offer is held here, in the process that produced the data, over
//! `ext-data-control-v1` (or the wlr spelling on an older compositor) — one dependency fewer, and a screenshot
//! no longer round-trips several megabytes through a pipe to a helper.
//!
//! Every copy takes a thread, which then blocks until something else copies. That is not a cost being paid
//! reluctantly: it *is* the selection. The compositor cancels the previous source when a new one arrives, so
//! the thread ends by itself and there is never more than one alive.

/// Copies `text` to the clipboard, off the UI thread — owning a selection means blocking for as long as it is
/// held, and a launcher's Enter handler runs on the frame.
