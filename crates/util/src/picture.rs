//! Reading an image file off disk into something a surface can draw.

//! Three surfaces want the same three lines — the wallpaper, the dashboard's avatar and its cover art — and
//! each one that wrote them itself would also have to decide for itself what a missing file means. It means
//! `None`: the caller falls back to a colour or a glyph rather than reserving space for a picture that is not
//! coming.
