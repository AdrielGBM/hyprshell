//! Owning the clipboard selection, by speaking the protocol rather than shelling out to `wl-copy`.
//!
//! Wayland has no way for a client to hand the compositor a *copy* of the selection: it registers a **source**
//! and then serves the bytes, on demand, to whoever pastes — possibly minutes later. That is why copying from a
//! one-shot process needs `wl-copy`, which exists to fork into the background and stay alive holding the
//! offer. A shell is already a long-lived process, so it is better placed to do that than a helper it has to
//! spawn: one fewer dependency, and the data never leaves the address space it was produced in.
//!
//! `ext-data-control-v1` is the standardised spelling and `zwlr-data-control-unstable-v1` the older one every
//! wlroots compositor still carries. Both are bound, because "which of the two" is the difference between
//! working on the current Hyprland and working on a two-year-old Sway.
//!
//! **A selection lives on its own thread**, one per copy. Setting a new selection makes the compositor send
//! `cancelled` to the previous source, so the thread that owned it ends by itself — no shared state, no
//! bookkeeping, and exactly the lifetime the protocol already defines.
