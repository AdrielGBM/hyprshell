//! Windows over `zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1`: which one has focus, where it is, and acting on it.
//!
//! The other half of a window list, and the only portable one. `ext-foreign-toplevel-list-v1` (`toplevels.rs`)
//! enumerates windows and gives each a stable identifier; it says nothing about which is focused, minimised or
//! fullscreen, reports no output, and offers no way to raise or close anything. This protocol answers all of
//! that and carries no identifier at all.
//!
//! **The two do not join.** A handle here and a handle there describe the same window and share nothing a
//! client could match on — not an id, not a serial, nothing but a title and an app id that any two windows of
//! the same application have in common. So a reading is taken from one protocol or the other in whole, never
//! assembled from both: "the focused window" comes from here, "the window to capture" from there.
//!
//! **What it cannot say either.** No geometry, no workspace, no process id. A window's position and size are
//! deliberately absent — `set_rectangle` sends a rectangle *to* the compositor, for the animation a minimise
//! comes out of, and there is no reverse. Anything needing those stays on a compositor's own IPC.
//!
//! **The watcher stops when the last registration is retired**, dropping its connection with it, and the next
//! [`watch`] starts a fresh one — the shell's rule that nothing is resident unless something is asking for it.
//! Bounded by the next event, as a polling producer is bounded by its next turn: until the compositor says
//! something the thread is asleep in `poll`, resident but not running.
