//! `ext-session-lock-v1`: the one surface role the compositor blanks the screen for.
//!
//! A lock surface is not a layer surface with a higher layer. The compositor stops rendering normal clients
//! entirely, refuses input to them, and will keep the session locked even if this process dies — which is what
//! makes it a lock rather than a very insistent overlay. The protocol's rules follow from that:
//!
//! - Lock surfaces must be created for **every** output the moment the lock object exists, and for any output
//!   plugged in afterwards, or the compositor blanks that screen to a solid colour instead.
//! - A second lock surface on one output is a protocol error, so [`LockSession::covered`] tracks which outputs
//!   already have one rather than trusting the surface list to stay in step.
//! - The first commit must follow an `ack_configure`, and the buffer must match the size it acked.
//! - Once the `locked` event has arrived, `destroy` is a protocol error — it must be `unlock_and_destroy`.
//!
//! The session lives on the driver, alongside the layer surfaces, because it shares everything they use: one
//! Wayland connection, one seat, one loop, and the same rsx handler path (a lock surface renders through
//! [`LayerWindow`] exactly as a bar does).
