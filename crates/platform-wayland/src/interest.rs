//! Whether a registration is still wanted, asked without calling it.
//!
//! Every watcher here keeps a list of callbacks and runs a thread and a connection to feed them, and the
//! shell's standing rule is that neither may outlive the last thing asking. The obvious way to express that —
//! a callback returning whether it wants to stay — cannot: a return value is only read when the callback is
//! called, so the registration of a compositor that has gone quiet is exactly the one that never gets to say
//! it is done, and the watcher goes on holding a connection for nobody.
//!
//! So the answer lives beside the registration instead of inside its return value, and a registry can prune
//! before it publishes rather than because it published. `EventSender::alive` answers the same question for a
//! surface's subscription; this is it for a raw callback.
//!
//! **One token per producer run, not per registration.** A producer that registers in two places — the
//! workspaces service reads a Wayland protocol *and* the compositor's event stream — has to retire both at
//! once. Retiring them one at a time leaves a window where the second asks `Broadcast::wanted` again, is told
//! a new subscriber has arrived, stays, and is then joined by the fresh producer's own registration.
