//! Reading pixels back off the compositor.
//!
//! A capture is not a surface: nothing is mapped, nothing is drawn, and the answer is wanted synchronously by
//! whoever asked. So this takes its own short-lived connection — the same shape [`enumerate_outputs`] uses —
//! rather than borrowing the driver's loop, which would mean pumping a screenshot's round trips through the
//! thread every bar is painted on.
//!
//! Two protocols answer the same question, and both are spoken. `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` is the standardised
//! successor and the route taken first; `zwlr-screencopy-v1` is what every wlroots compositor has carried for
//! years and is the fallback. The same two-spelling shape [`crate::clipboard`] takes, for the same reason: which
//! of the two is the difference between working on the current Hyprland and working on a two-year-old Sway.
//!
//! The newer protocol will not crop. It captures a *source* whole and has no region request, so a selection is
//! read back at output size and cut here — which is what [`region`] is, and why the older route is not simply
//! the worse one.
//!
//! [`enumerate_outputs`]: crate::enumerate_outputs
