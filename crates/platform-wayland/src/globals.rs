//! Asking the compositor what it advertises, from anywhere.
//!
//! The other "is this supported" answers in this crate read state the driver put there — `lock_supported`
//! asks the driver facts, `idle_supported` a thread-local the event loop owns — which is right inside a
//! running shell and silently wrong outside one, where both answer `false` because there is no driver rather
//! than because the compositor is missing the protocol.
//!
//! That distinction is the whole point of asking: `hyprshell deps` runs in a bare CLI process, on the machine
//! where something is broken, quite possibly *because* the shell will not start. So this connects on its own
//! and reads the registry, and separates "the compositor does not have it" from "nothing here could tell".
