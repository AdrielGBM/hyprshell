//! Colour temperature over `zwlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1`: warming the screen without a helper process.
//!
//! A night light is a gamma ramp per output, and this protocol is the portable way to set one. Every wlroots
//! compositor carries it, so nothing here needs `hyprsunset`, `gammastep` or `wlsunset` running alongside.
//!
//! **The control object *is* the setting.** The compositor restores the original ramp the moment the
//! `zwlr_gamma_control_v1` is destroyed — which is the protocol keeping a crashed client from leaving a screen
//! orange for ever, and which means turning the tint off is dropping the object rather than sending a neutral
//! ramp. It also means the objects have to be held for as long as the tint lasts, so this owns a connection and
//! a thread the way the workspace and toplevel watchers do.
//!
//! **Only one client at a time.** A compositor grants gamma control to one client per output; a second gets
//! `failed`. That is reported rather than retried, because the honest answer to "something else already owns
//! the gamma" is to say so and leave that something else alone.
