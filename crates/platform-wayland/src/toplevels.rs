//! Open windows over `ext-foreign-toplevel-list-v1`: what exists, what it is called, and a handle on it.
//!
//! The enumeration a dock, a window switcher and an open-window launcher mode all rest on, read from the
//! compositor rather than from one compositor's IPC.
//!
//! **The identifier is the join.** Each toplevel carries an opaque, stable string the compositor promises is
//! unique for that window's whole life. On Hyprland it is exactly the `stableId` of `hyprctl clients` —
//! verified against a live 0.56.1 session — which is what lets a reading taken here be matched against one
//! taken over IPC by equality rather than by guessing from titles.
//!
//! **What this protocol does not carry.** A toplevel handle reports a title, an app id and that identifier. It
//! does *not* report which workspace or output the window is on, whether it is focused, minimised or
//! fullscreen, and it offers no way to act on the window — `zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1` is the only
//! portable route to any of that. A list built from this alone is a list, not a switcher.
//!
//! It is also the only way to *name* a window as a capture source: `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` will capture a
//! toplevel, but only one identified by the `ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1` that only this protocol hands out.
//!
//! **The watcher stops when the last registration is retired**, dropping its connection with it, and the next
//! [`watch`] starts a fresh one. Unlike the other three watchers here this one is read-only — the protocol has
//! no requests — so there is nothing to talk to it over and the running flag is the whole of its slot. Teardown
//! is bounded by the next event either way: until the compositor says a window opened or closed, the thread is
//! asleep in `poll`, resident but not running.
