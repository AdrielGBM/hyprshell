//! Every window the shell opens that is not the wallpaper, the frame or a bar.
//!
//! [`Placement`] settled where a surface *sits*. This settles what a surface *is*: eleven windows that each
//! resolved their own config, set their own theme, declared their own transparency and answered their own
//! `clear_color`, in eleven copies of the same eight lines — and each one free to leave a line out.
//!
//! Eight of them left out the same one. None installed a [`SurfaceEnv`], so their content resolved the *global*
//! config through [`surface_env`](config::surface_env) instead of their own, per-monitor overrides never
//! reached them, and [`panel_fill`] answered a solid colour to panels the user had configured translucent —
//! silently, because falling back is not an error. That was not eleven bugs waiting to happen; it was one bug
//! that had already happened eleven times over and only showed once.
//!
//! So a panel names the four things that actually differ between one window and the next — where it sits
//! ([`Placement`]), which edge its content resolves against, whether it slides in, and what it draws — and this
//! does the rest. The next setting like `[panels] opacity` lands in one place.
//!
//! **What is deliberately not a panel.** The wallpaper is opaque by definition and clears to a colour. The
//! frame paints a ring and has no content to resolve anything for. A bar has zones, a reserved strip, per-edge
//! shape and auto-hide. The lock screen is mounted by the compositor's session rather than opened here, and is
//! the one surface that must never be translucent. Those four earn their own types; nothing else does.
