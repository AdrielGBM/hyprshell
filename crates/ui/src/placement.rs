//! Where a surface sits, as one vocabulary.
//!
//! Every window this shell puts on screen used to describe itself: five modules built a whole `LayerConfig`
//! by hand, three more went through the surface host's own placement type, and each named its layer-shell
//! namespace in a string literal of its own. The result was four ways to say "a panel anchored to an edge"
//! and no way to tell, from one of them, what the others had decided.
//!
//! There is one way here. A [`Placement`] is built from a **named primitive** — the shape the surface takes on
//! screen — and adjusted with the handful of modifiers a surface actually varies: its size, its margin, how
//! much of the keyboard it wants, what it does with the pointer. The primitives are the shell's whole
//! taxonomy of windows:
//!
//! | Primitive | The shape | Who takes it |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`bar`](Placement::bar) | spans an edge, reserves nothing itself | the bars |
//! | [`reservation`](Placement::reservation) | invisible, carves an edge's strip | the bars' strips |
//! | [`backdrop`](Placement::backdrop) | the whole screen, click-through, reserving nothing | wallpaper, frame ring |
//! | [`desktop`](Placement::desktop) | what the bars left free, click-through | the desktop widgets |
//! | [`dock`](Placement::dock) | spans an edge, over the windows | the notification centre |
//! | [`stack`](Placement::stack) | pinned to a spot along an edge, input from its content | toasts, notification popups |
//! | [`off_chip`](Placement::off_chip) | hangs off the chip that opened it | popouts, drawers, the tray menu |
//! | [`centred`](Placement::centred) | a window in the middle of the screen | a module's float, the launcher |
//! | [`screen`](Placement::screen) | the whole screen, over everything, takes the keyboard | the region picker |
//!
//! Two of those rows used to be four. A popout, a drawer and the tray's menu are one *position* — the chip's
//! rect and the bar's edge — asked for by three callers, and describing them apart is what let the menu be built
//! as a card that had been made dismissable, which quietly turned it into a drawer built through the wrong door
//! and announcing a namespace nobody chose. A float and the launcher are likewise one shape, differing in how
//! they go away. What actually varies in each pair is [`OffChip`] and [`Centred`], and those say what the
//! surface *is*, not where it goes.
//!
//! **The namespace belongs to the shape, not to the surface.** It is what a compositor rule matches
//! (`layer_rule = blur, hyprshell-drawer`), so it is a public interface: the strings below are the ones
//! hyprshell has always announced, and a primitive owns its own rather than each call site spelling it out.
//!
//! A placement is lowered at the point of use: to a [`LayerConfig`] for a surface that owns its rendering, or
//! to the surface host's [`SurfacePlacement`] for one that wants the scaffold — a scrim, a dismiss-on-outside,
//! an entrance. Which of the two a surface needs is not a property of where it sits, so it is not decided
//! here; see the surface reconciler.
