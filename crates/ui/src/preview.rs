//! The per-component half of the world a `[preview]` builds against.
//!
//! The process-wide half — theme, locale, config, icon store — is seeded once by the `setup` closure
//! `telar::dev_entry` runs, and belongs there. What is left is per component, because it is scoped to a build:
//! a chip reads which bar it is on through [`SurfaceEnv`], and a preview that provides none draws at the
//! fallbacks instead of at the bar the user actually runs.
