//! Which card a chip shows when the pointer rests on it.
//!
//! The hover surface's counterpart to [`crate::panels`], and registered for the same reason: the popout is one
//! card-shaped surface that opens under whichever chip was hovered, and naming the modules it can show would be
//! the one thing stopping it from being built without them.
//!
//! A builder yields a [`Card`] rather than a finished tree, because the surface owns the frame around it — the
//! panel fill, the bar's radius and the pointer tracking that keeps the popout up — and a card that built its
//! own box could not be told any of that.
