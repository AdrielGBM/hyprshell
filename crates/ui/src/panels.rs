//! Which module id a panel surface fills itself from.
//!
//! A drawer, a float and the settings preview all show *a module's panel*, and none of them knows which module
//! that is until it opens. The mapping used to be a `match` beside the drawer, which meant the surface that
//! merely presents a panel had to name every module that has one — the one edge that stopped the surfaces
//! being buildable without them. Registered instead, by whoever owns the module list.
//!
//! The keyboard mode is registered with the builder rather than beside it, because the two cannot be allowed to
//! drift: a panel that gains a text field and is not granted the keyboard is a field that cannot be typed into.
//! Asking for it costs more than an unused capability — a layer surface granted keyboard focus takes it from
//! the focused window, and the compositor re-focuses that window when the panel closes; a layout that follows
//! focus moves the viewport on the way back — so a panel that only displays readings must not ask.
