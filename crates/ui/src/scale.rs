//! The sizes the shell draws itself at, named by size rather than by use.
//!
//! A token named for where it is used is a lie the first time someone needs it somewhere else: `CARD_RADIUS`
//! on a row invites either a wrong name or a fresh literal, and the shell collected sixty of the second kind.
//! A T-shirt size says only how big it is, which is the only thing a step on a scale knows about itself.
//!
//! **Radius has a source; space does not, and the difference is deliberate.** A corner radius is a theme token
//! the user configures (`[shape] radius`, per bar, falling back to the palette's own), so the scale is
//! *derived* from whatever this surface resolved — set it to `0` and the whole shell squares off together
//! instead of only its panel corners. Nothing configures an inset, so those are plain constants until
//! something does.
//!
//! **Every inset and every gap is on the scale, including inside a widget.** They ran 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 as often
//! as 4, 8, 16 across 84 padding literals and 110 gap literals, which looks at first like per-widget tuning
//! and is not: nothing here was ever measured against anything else, so the spread is what a number picked
//! afresh each time looks like. Six steps on a 4px grid, and a value that is not one of them is a bug.
