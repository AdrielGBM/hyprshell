//! Feral's GameMode: whether the machine is in its performance profile, and a switch to hold it there.
//!
//! GameMode is a reference count, not a flag. Games register themselves while they run and the daemon applies
//! the governor and scheduling changes for as long as at least one client is registered. So "turn game mode
//! on" from a shell means registering a client of its own — the shell's process — and "off" means dropping it,
//! which is exactly what `gamemoded -r` / `-u` do and why the toggle here reports separately whether *this*
//! shell is the one holding it: a game that is already running keeps game mode on whatever the shell does.
