//! The wall clock as a shared source. A clock is the one thing here that genuinely has to tick rather than
//! wait for an event, so the point of routing it through a service is that the whole shell ticks **once**: the
//! bar chip, the clock panel and any other surface all read the same broadcast instead of each arming its own
//! timer. The producer also sleeps to the next second boundary, so the displayed second changes when the system
//! second does instead of drifting by however long the shell took to start.
