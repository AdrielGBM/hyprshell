//! Bluetooth, through BlueZ's D-Bus API.
//!
//! Everything the shell shows and every action it offers comes from one object tree: BlueZ publishes the
//! adapter and every known device under `org.bluez` as managed objects, and emits `InterfacesAdded`,
//! `InterfacesRemoved` and `PropertiesChanged` as they change. So there is nothing to poll — one subscription
//! covers a device connecting, a scan finding a new one, a headset's battery dropping and the adapter being
//! switched off.
//!
//! Two threads, for the same reason the tray needs them: the reader parks on a `MessageIterator` and must never
//! block on a method call, so it only pings, and a refresher owns the connection that re-reads the tree. A
//! scan emits an `RSSI` update per device per second, which is exactly the burst a coalescing refresher exists
//! to fold into one re-read.
