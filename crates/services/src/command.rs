//! The shell's command surface, as a producer sees it.
//!
//! Two services run what the *user* configured rather than what their own code says: `[idle]` fires a request
//! line at each stage, and a bound global shortcut is a request line the desktop portal delivers. Neither knows
//! the command table — it lives with the socket, above here — so both go through the hooks below, installed
//! once at startup by whoever owns that table.
//!
//! [`Request`] lives here rather than beside the socket for the same reason: a shortcut and a `hyprshell …`
//! invocation must produce the *same* thing, and only one of the two can see the socket.
