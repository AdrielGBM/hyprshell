//! NVIDIA's own management library, for the readings the kernel does not publish.
//!
//! AMD and Intel put utilisation and VRAM in `/sys/class/drm`, so the shell reads them for free. NVIDIA
//! publishes nothing there — the driver keeps its counters behind NVML — which is why the GPU card used to
//! fork `nvidia-smi` **once per reading**, on the dashboard's poll interval. That is the expensive pattern
//! this shell avoids everywhere else: a process start to answer a number.
//!
//! **Loaded at runtime, not linked**, for the same reason as [`pam`](super::pam): linking `libnvidia-ml` would
//! make an NVIDIA driver a build dependency of a shell that has to run on machines with an AMD card and no
//! NVIDIA anything. `dlopen` turns "no NVIDIA here" into a question answered once, at startup, by a library
//! that simply is not there.
//!
//! Only the six symbols a GPU card needs. NVML is a large API and none of the rest of it has a reader here.
