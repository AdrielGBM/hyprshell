//! The audio graph as one shared source, read from PipeWire itself.
//!
//! This replaces a `wpctl` fork every two seconds. Two things were wrong with that beyond the cost: a poll
//! answers one question per fork, so a level the user changed from another mixer took up to two seconds to
//! reach the bar; and `wpctl get-volume` returns a single number, which is why the shell could show a level
//! and a mute state and nothing else — no device list, no per-application stream.
//!
//! `pw-dump --monitor` is the whole graph, once, and then a line per change. One subprocess for the shell,
//! parsed on one thread, published as one snapshot. `wpctl` stays for *mutations*: it already resolves
//! `@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@` and does the volume curve, and writing was never the part that needed fixing.
//!
//! A machine with no PipeWire publishes nothing at all, which is the same thing the poll did when `wpctl` was
//! missing — every consumer already treats `None` as "no audio here".
