//! The open windows, as the compositor itself lists them.
//!
//! Deliberately not part of [`crate::hyprland`]: `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` is spoken by every wlroots
//! compositor, so nothing here needs a Hyprland to answer. What it costs is a narrower window than
//! `hyprland::clients` — a title, an application id, the outputs it sits on and its state, with no geometry, no
//! workspace and no process id, because the protocol carries none of those. A caller wanting those wants the
//! client list and therefore wants Hyprland.
