//! The sound coming out of the speakers, as a row of bars.
//!
//! One PipeWire stream on the default sink's *monitor* — what is being played, not what a microphone hears —
//! feeds a windowed FFT, and each transform is folded into the handful of log-spaced bands a visualiser draws.
//! The shell's usual rule applies: one capture for the whole process, however many surfaces subscribe.
//!
//! **A visualiser is the one service that can undo the idle budget**, because its data source never stops: a
//! monitor stream delivers silence at exactly the same rate it delivers music, so a naive producer would wake
//! every surface sixty times a second in front of a paused player. Two things prevent that. Nothing starts
//! until something subscribes — `Service` is lazy — and a frame identical to the one before it is not
//! published, so silence costs one final all-zero frame and then nothing at all until sound returns. That is
//! also what gives every consumer its auto-hide for free: [`Spectrum::silent`] is a reading, not a timer.
