//! Taking a picture of the screen.
//!
//! The pixels come from the compositor over a protocol — `ext-image-copy-capture` where there is one, older
//! `wlr-screencopy` where there is not — which the platform crate owns. This layer is what happens to them
//! afterwards: composing several outputs into one desktop, cropping a selection, encoding once, and deciding
//! whether that goes to a file, to the clipboard or to an annotator.
//!
//! Everything here runs off the UI thread. A capture is a round trip to the compositor followed by a PNG encode
//! of several megapixels; done in a click handler it would drop frames on every surface at once.
