//!
//! **Loaded at runtime, not linked.** A lock screen is the last feature that may make the rest of the shell
//! unbuildable: linking `libpam` would put PAM headers between a user and a working bar. Loading it on demand
//! keeps the binary portable, lets `[lock] pam_library` name a path on a distribution that puts the library
//! outside the loader's search path, and — the part that matters — turns "no PAM here" into a question the
//! shell can ask *before* it locks the screen rather than a failure it discovers after.
//!
//! **Every call runs on a worker thread.** `pam_authenticate` talks to `pam_unix`, which sleeps for seconds
//! after a wrong password by design, and may talk to a fingerprint reader or a network directory. On the UI
//! thread that is a frozen shell; here it is a spinner.
