//! One D-Bus connection per (bus, method timeout) instead of one per call.
//!
//! Opening a connection is not cheap: a socket, an auth handshake, an executor thread and a message queue. A
//! service that opens one inside a poll loop or a click handler pays that several times a second, and every
//! live connection costs a thread whose allocations glibc scatters across its own malloc arena.
//!
//! The timeout is part of the key because it is a per-connection setting in zbus and the services mean
//! different things by it — a tray read gives up after 2 s, a VPN action is allowed 60 s. Collapsing those onto
//! one connection would silently retime every call made through it.
