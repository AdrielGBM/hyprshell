//! One PipeWire capture stream, in this process rather than behind a pipe.
//!
//! The visualiser needs what the speakers are playing, and reading it used to cost a `pw-cat`: a process, a
//! pipe and a copy per hop, running for as long as anything was subscribed. That was the one genuinely hot
//! subprocess this shell had left. Here it is a `pw_stream` on a main loop of its own, handing the samples
//! straight to a closure.
//!
//! **Loaded at runtime, not linked**, for the same reason as [`nvml`](super::nvml) and [`pam`](super::pam):
//! linking `libpipewire-0.3` would make PipeWire a *build* dependency of a shell that degrades to silent bars
//! without it at runtime, and would put a second library between a clone and a working bar. The other two
//! PipeWire helpers stay subprocesses on purpose — `pw-dump --monitor` is one long-lived process that parses
//! only when the graph changes, and `wpctl` is one fork per volume change. Neither is hot; this one was.
//!
//! **The callback runs on the main loop, not the data thread.** Without `PW_STREAM_FLAG_RT_PROCESS` PipeWire
//! hands `process` to the loop this thread is running, which is what makes it safe to do a transform and wake
//! every subscribed surface from inside it. With that flag it would be the realtime graph thread, where both
//! are a missed deadline for every other application on the machine.
//!
//! **Exactly one format is offered**, so negotiation either produces f32 mono at the asked rate or fails
//! outright — which is what makes reading a buffer as `f32` safe without parsing the negotiated format back.
//! The conversion happens in the stream's own adapter, and `node.rate` is deliberately not set: asking the
//! *graph* to run at 44.1 kHz would make every other application resample for a row of bars, which is a thing
//! `pw-cat --rate` does and this does not.
