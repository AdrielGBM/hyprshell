//! External monitors over DDC/CI, through `ddcutil`.
//!
//! The only way to dim a desktop monitor: it has no sysfs backlight, because the panel's backlight is the monitor's
//! own business and the cable is how you ask. `ddcutil` speaks that protocol over the I²C bus behind each output,
//! and there is no library worth binding — the CLI is the interface every other shell uses too.
//!
//! Two things make it unlike the internal backlight, and both shape the service around it. It is a *process*, so
//! every call has a deadline and none of them may happen on the UI thread. And a `getvcp` is slow enough (tens to
//! hundreds of milliseconds per monitor) that reading one on a timer would be a permanent background cost for a
//! value that only changes when somebody changes it — so levels are read once at detection and then tracked
//! optimistically, which is why a change made with the monitor's own buttons is not noticed.
