//! Idle timeouts and what holds them off.
//!
//! Every stage in `[idle]` becomes one `ext-idle-notify-v1` notification, and the compositor — the only thing
//! that sees the input devices — says when it elapses. What the stage then *does* is a request line the shell
//! already answers, so `hyprshell --list` is the whole vocabulary and anything bindable to a key is bindable
//! to a timeout.
//!
//! An inhibit is expressed by having no notification at all rather than by ignoring one that fires. A stage
//! that is inhibited is not armed, so the compositor never counts down for it, and un-inhibiting re-arms from
//! zero — which is what a user expects after closing the film that was holding the screen awake, rather than
//! the lock screen appearing the moment it ends.
