//! What the shell says a toast about.
//!
//! Every watcher here follows the same two rules, and both are the difference between feedback and noise.
//!
//! **Only a change is an event.** `watch` hands a subscriber the current reading immediately, so a handler that
//! toasted on delivery would put a card on screen for every service the moment the shell started. Each watcher
//! remembers what it last saw and says nothing about the first one.
//!
//! **A watcher only exists if its toast is switched on.** Subscribing starts the service behind it — a D-Bus
//! connection, or in the lock keys' case a poll — so a user who switched an event off pays nothing for it. This
//! is why the set is decided from the config here rather than filtered at the point the toast is posted.
