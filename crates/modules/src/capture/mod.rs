//! The capture flows: what a keybind, a chip or an IPC call means by "take a screenshot" or "record this".
//!
//! The services below know how to capture pixels and drive a recorder; this is the layer that decides *which*
//! pixels and what to do with them, so every entry point — a bar chip, `hyprshell screenshot region`, the
//! utilities panel — performs the same flow rather than each assembling its own request.
