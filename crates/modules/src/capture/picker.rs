//! The region picker: a full-screen overlay the user draws a rectangle on.
//!
//! Three decisions are worth knowing about.
//!
//! **The still is the capture.** With `[screenshot] freeze` on, the overlay is drawn over a picture of the screen
//! taken the instant before it mapped, and the selection is *cropped out of that picture*. Asking the compositor
//! again afterwards would photograph the overlay, and waiting for the overlay to go away first would lose the
//! menu or hover state the user was trying to capture — which is the whole reason to freeze.
//!
//! **A click is a selection too.** Dragging a box is the general case, but "this window" is the common one, so a
//! press with no travel selects the window under the pointer, and one on empty desktop selects the whole output.
//! Edges within a few pixels of a window snap to it, so a rough drag still comes out flush.
//!
//! **It covers the focused screen.** A selection is made on one monitor; the overlay opens on the focused one and
//! reports its rectangle in the compositor's global logical coordinates, which is what every consumer wants.
