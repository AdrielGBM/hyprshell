//! What this crate's `[preview]`s stand in for: the machine a headless render cannot reach.
//!
//! Each seeds its service rather than starting it — see [`util::broadcast::Service::seed`] — so a preview draws
//! the same thing on a laptop, on a build box and with the shell already running. The bar every chip sits on
//! comes from [`ui::preview`].
