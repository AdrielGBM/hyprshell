//! The column of cards the shell pins to a screen edge and takes away again.
//!
//! **Three surfaces became one.** A notification popup, an in-shell toast and the OSD a volume change flashes
//! were three stacks with three `edge`s, three widths and three timeouts, and being three is what let them open
//! in three different places, overlap each other on a narrow screen, and have no one of them able to know. They
//! are one column now, in arrival order, and where it sits is `[stack]`.
//!
//! What stayed apart is what is actually different. Each card is still built by the module that owns it — a
//! notification by the card with its actions and its swipe, a toast by its own, an OSD by its meter — and each
//! still comes from its own source. This merges them; it knows nothing about what any of them mean.
//!
//! **Only three things vary per card**, and they are the three that used to be a whole config section each:
//!
//! - **Its key**, so a second reading about the same thing replaces the first in place rather than pushing a
//!   copy underneath it. A wheel spun ten notches is one OSD, not ten.
//! - **Whether it expires**, which is not a second timeout: a `critical` notification under `critical_sticky`
//!   waits to be dealt with, and everything else goes at `[stack] timeout_ms`. Each source still times its own
//!   cards out — the daemon its notifications, the toaster its toasts — because the one thing they cannot rely
//!   on is a surface being up to do it for them.
//! - **Whether it takes the pointer.** A notification is pressed and swiped; an OSD is feedback about a key
//!   being held and must never be in the way of the click behind it. The surface carves its input region out of
//!   what registers as pressable, so a card that registers nothing simply is not in the region.
//!
//! The surface exists only while the column has something in it — opened on the first card, dropped with the
//! last — so an idle session carries no overlay at all. That is the toast host's old rule applied to the
//! notification popup too, which used to stay mapped around the clock because the daemon owns the timing.
