/// surface took the press, without consulting the input region again. It is a card *left* displaced that is
/// unreachable — no press can land on it to put it back — and a card with no timeout, a sticky `critical`
/// notification above all, then stays up until the shell is restarted. Resetting on every ending, rather than
/// only on the snap-back, is what bounds the mismatch to the moment it is harmless.
