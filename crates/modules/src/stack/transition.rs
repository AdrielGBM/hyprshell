//! How a card arrives and how it leaves.
//!
//! The same shape as [`ui::panel::panel_transition`], and deliberately so: one `Animated` progress where **1 is
//! away and transparent, 0 is settled**, so the exit is the entrance reversed rather than a second animation
//! that has to be kept in step with the first. It is built away from its goal and retargeted at once, never at
//! the goal — an `Animated` born settled never registers with the ticker, so nothing would schedule the frames
//! that carry it in.
//!
//! Applied by the column to every card it holds rather than by each module to its own, which is what makes a
//! notification, a toast and an OSD arrive the same way. Before this they simply appeared: `ReactiveList` builds
//! a new row and disposes a gone one in the same breath, so nothing on screen distinguished the card that just
//! arrived from the four that had been there, or said that one had left rather than been replaced.
//!
//! **A card cannot borrow the panel's exit.** A panel animates out because the driver holds its whole *surface*
//! mapped for as long as `on_close` asks; a card is one row inside a surface shared with every other card, and
//! the list drops it the instant its source does. So the progress lives here, keyed by slot, where the column
//! can reach it after the card's own widget is gone — [`leaving`] is the column saying "play the exit", and
//! [`settled`] is it collecting what has finished.
